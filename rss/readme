Understanding content is in "readme" file locatede in upper directory.
follow steps for running rss experiment:-
	make
	cd experiment
	gcc testing.c
	sudo dmesg -C
	./a.out &
	sudo insmod ../rss.ko pid=<pid of above process>
//concurrently check top -p <pid of a.out> and compare virtual and rss with dmesg's last row.
	sudo rmmod ../rss.ko #when process a.out completes.
	dmesg > all_log.txt

On every 3 sec, our module calculates vm and rss size for given process.
This module traverses the entire virtual memory area and searches for page table entry corresponding to that adrress. 
If there is pte then it checks whether page is actually present in memory or not. If it is then increment rss count.

for correctness check experiment directory.
