noaccess.c :- 
	There are 10 iterations. For each iteration, it first allocates memory then sleeps for 4 sec then frees and again sleeps for 8 sec.
	In each successive iteration the size of memory increases by 4000KB. 
	Since there is not any memory aceess, the rss size should remain same. This can be verified by observing noaccess.log file.

	See in log file(noaccess.log), at every 12 sec vma size increase but rss remains almost same.

fixed_access.c :- 
	It does followings:-
		1)allocates ~16MB memory and sleep for 5 sec
		2)4 round of memory access,sleep(5) in between each round
		3)frees the memory.
	Expected output:-
		rss size should not increase after step (1).
		rss size should be ~16MB during step (2).
		rss size should be decrease to initial size after (3).
	Actual output:- (see fixed_aceess.log)
		It is as per expectation.

create_access_delete.c :-
	There are 10 iterations, During each iteration, it does followings:-
		1)allocates 4MB*[iteration_number] memory and sleep(5) e.g. In 2nd iteration, it allocates 4MB*2=8MB memory.
		2)visits memory then sleep(5)
		3)free the previously allocated memory.
		4)sleep(10)
	Expected output:-
		vma should increase but not rss during step 1.
		rss should increase in step 2
		both vma and rss should decrease after step(3).
	Actual output:-
		see create_access_delete.log
