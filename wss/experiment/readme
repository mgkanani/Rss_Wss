test_var_size.c :-
	There are 10 iteration. In each iteration,it does followings:-
		1)for iterate_count i, allocates i*4MB memory
		2)sleep(5)
		3)1st for loop which accesses once each page of previously allocated memory.
		4)sleep(4)
		5)2nd for loop accesses all pages from previous allocation.
		6)sleep(4)
		7)3rd for loop only accesses half number of pages from previous allocation.
		8)sleep(8)
		9)free()
		10)sleep(4)
	Expected output:-
		-After step(1) only vma should increase by ~i*4MB
		-After step(3) only rss should increase by ~i*4MB but not wss because we are not considering first page fault into wss count.
		-After step(5) wss should increase by ~i*4MB
		-After step(7) wss should be halfen of wss after step(5).
		-After step(9) vma and rss should decrease by ~i*4MB.
	Actual output:-
		see test_var_size.log file, It is as per expectation. log file has been explained within it.


Correctness:-
1) first page fault is not incrementing wss count:-
	In log file see the outcome after 1st for loop
2) wss count give correct value:-
	In log file compare the wss size of 2nd-for-loop and 3rd-for-loop. In 3rd-for-loop, the wss size is halfened than 2nd-for-loop since it is actually accesses half pages than 2nd-for-loop.
